Requirements for py_tld:

 - run on python2.7
 - need script fully commented 


 - input:  csv text files (< 2GB ) 
   - multiple urls in 23rd column (# need to be able to change to 26 column sometimes and see how i can just replace 23 with 26 in jarkmain.py in order to do so)
 
   - URLS consist of subdomains, domains, top level domains
  
     - example: in "http://www.google.com/?abc=def":
     - 'www' is the subdomain
     - 'google' is the domain
     - 'com' is the tld
   

  - output: list of ordered URLs as defined by tldextract by count
    - format in .txt
    - need count of domains
    - the counts need be summed by file not by record/row
    * ideally would have the top level domains (e.g., .gov.uk) in a corresponding column so that the domains would be actionable and ready to open/call
