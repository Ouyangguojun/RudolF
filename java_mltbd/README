This is a source tree for JVM research

The main class JvmResearch has a Mongo Database connection to supply test data

It spawns worker threads that populate an embedded Derby database with test data

At the moment the simple idea is to generate a heap "out of memory" error by
generating many threads

To research optimizing the mongo and jdbc object heavy  loop,  

an  initial tool for profiling, tracing and obtaining  stack traces is

"Java VisualVM" a standard tool in the java SDK bin directory
