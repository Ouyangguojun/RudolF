This is a source tree for JVM research

The main class JvmResearch.java  uses  a Mongo Database to supply test data

It spawns worker threads that populate an embedded Derby database with the  test data

At the moment the simple idea is to generate a heap "out of memory" error by generating 
many threads and to research optimizing the mongo and jdbc object heavy  loop for the JIT,  

an  initial tool for profiling, tracing and obtaining  stack traces is "Java VisualVM" 
a standard tool in the java SDK bin directory

in the SDK bin directory or anywhere else if your path is set a shell cmd "jvisualvm" 
will run the VisualVM tool. For the first run the tool calibrates performance so for 
best results run the tool for the first time as the only process running on your machine.
