/**  This class is the SuperClass point for the Bench Mark Classes, it obtains a report String
 *  from the bench mark classes dev.benchmarks.MapResults and dev.benchmarks.ListResults, 
 *  it then passes this along to the main class dev.JvmResearch.java  for reporting as a 
 *  simple screen dump. During the benchmarking we poll the thread groups for thread 
 *  data and aggregate this into the bench mark report.
 *  
 *  From this class we can measure the memory cost of the java.util.concurrent  Collections
 *  CopyOnWriteArrayList and ConcurrentMap compared to the standard Collections classes
 * 
 *  From this class we can gain understanding of concurrency and its implications for the Java Memory Model
 *  
 *  @ mapTask is  benchmark thread for concurrent map
