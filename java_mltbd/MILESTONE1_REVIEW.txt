1) I would suggest using modern java.util.concurrent packages rather than pure threads.

2) Comments are looking reasonably.  Keep them up. 

3) Why do we need to use both Derby and Mongo? I'm sort of afraid that they might counfounding the purity of the experiments.  Lets move to something
a little less complex for the benchmarking for the next iteration. Can we pick one of them ?

4) Code overall looks good. 

5) Can you start sharing screenshots on campfire of your setup ?  On macs this is easy (apple+shift+3)

6) Can the benchmarks be packaged up as Unit tests ? Or in some other more structured format.  I'd like a single executable.
