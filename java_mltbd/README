The main class JvmResearch.java  uses  sun.misc.Unsafe.class to obtain the 
allocated memory size in bytes for a range of data structures.

It implements the process in a loop and the results are stored in a Bench Mark
SQL database this object heavy  loop will be optimized for the JIT,  

The main class JvmResearchDMA.java uses  sun.misc.Unsafe.class to create
an off heap  object by copying the memory address of an object on the JVM
heap to a native buffer output address

an  initial tool for profiling, tracing and obtaining  stack traces is 
"Java VisualVM"  a standard tool from 1.6.07 in the java SDK bin directory

In the SDK bin directory or anywhere else if your path is set a shell cmd 
"jvisualvm"  will run the VisualVM tool. For the first run the tool calibrates 
performance so for best results run the tool for the first time as the only 
process running on your machine.
